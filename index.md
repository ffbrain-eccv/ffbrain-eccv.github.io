# Call for papers

## Scope of the workshop

Advances in artificial intelligence and computational modeling have spurred a new era in understanding complex systems. Foundation models, characterized by their ability to integrate diverse data modalities, have emerged as powerful tools in unraveling the complex systems. 
The workshop, "Towards Multimodal Foundational Models for Modelling Visual Cortex", is poised at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, computer science and computational modeling, aiming to explore techniques and methodologies for creating foundational models that may comprehensively represent visual cortex either in humans or in animals.
Thus, this workshop serves as a focal point for researchers and practitioners interested in the realization and applications of foundation models to brain modeling. It seeks to not only define the state-of-the-art in multimodal visual cortex modeling but also to propel the field forward by addressing challenges and charting a roadmap for future research, offering both theoretical advancements and practical insights for creating foundational models as effective in modeling and understanding the visual systems  as those in other areas such as NLP, computer vision and robotics. 
The workshop will facilitate discussions on methodological advancements, challenges associated with integrating disparate data sources (fMRI, EEG, in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, fNIRS, etc.), the learning paradigms with noisy data, and the ethical implications of creating/utilizing foundational models.
