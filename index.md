# Call for papers

## Scope of the workshop

The field of brain modeling is undergoing a revolutionary transition with the integration of artificial intelligence and computational modeling techniques. Foundational models, known for their capacity to assimilate a variety of data types, stand at the forefront of this transformation, offering unprecedented insights into the complexity of the human brain. The workshop titled "Towards Multimodal Foundational Models for Brain Modelling" is situated at the nexus of neuroscience, genomics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and computational modeling. Its primary objective is to delve into the development and application of foundational models that can encapsulate the human brain in its entirety.

This workshop aims to be a hub for scholars and professionals who are at the cutting edge of foundation model research and application in brain modeling. It will provide a platform to establish the current benchmarks in multimodal brain modeling and to advance the field by tackling existing challenges and outlining a strategic direction for future inquiries. Attendees will benefit from a mix of theoretical knowledge and practical insights, enabling them to craft foundational models with the same level of effectiveness as those applied in other domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
